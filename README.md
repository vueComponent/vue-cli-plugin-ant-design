# vue-cli-plugin-ant-design
Ant-Design-Vue plugin for `@vue/cli` 3.0.

### Install

First you need to install `@vue/cli` globally (follow the instructions [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)).

Then create a project and add the ant-design-vue plugin:

```bash
vue create my-app
cd my-app
vue add ant-design
```

You'll be asked some questions regarding how ant-design-vue is configured in your project. After that, you're good to go.
 
### Use with vue-cli UI

Skip this part if you've done everything in the `Install` section.

If you prefer managing your project in vue-cli UI (by running `vue ui`), here's how you can add Ant-Design-Vue plugin: go to the Plugins menu, click the upper right `+ Add plugin` button, find `vue-cli-plugin-vue-cli-plugin-ant-design` and install it.
